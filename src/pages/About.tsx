              Eluro was born from a simple belief: the things we choose to keep 
              should be worth keeping. In a world of endless options, we curate 
              what matters—products made with intention, built to last.
            </p>

            <p>
              Every piece in our collection is thoughtfully chosen. We work with 
              artisans who share our dedication to quality, selecting materials 
              that age beautifully and designs that transcend trends.
            </p>

            <p>
              We don't believe in urgency tactics or fleeting sales. Our approach 
              is calm, considered, and centered on trust. When you choose Eluro, 
              you're choosing something meant to be part of your life for years 
              to come.
            </p>
